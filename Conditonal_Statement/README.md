# **Conditional Statements in Go** 

Conditional statements help your program make decisions based on conditions. Think of them like a flowchart where your code can take different paths depending on certain situations.

**Comparison Operators (Check conditions):** 

**==** → "Is equal to?" (checks if two values are the same)

**>** → "Is greater than?"

**>=** → "Is greater than or equal to?"

**<** → "Is less than?"

**<=** → "Is less than or equal to?"

 **Logical Operators (Combine conditions):**

**&&** → "AND" → Both conditions must be true

**||** → "OR" → At least one condition must be true
