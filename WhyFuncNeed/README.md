# **Why Use Functions**
**Avoid repetition** → Don't rewrite the same code

**Easy debugging** → Fix problems in one place

**Better organization** → Break complex problems into small pieces

**Team collaboration** → Different people can work on different functions

**Code reuse** → Use the same function in multiple programs
