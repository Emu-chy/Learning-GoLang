# **Functions in Go**
What is a Function?
A function is like a personal assistant or a mini-program within  main program. It's a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.

## Key Characteristics:
### 1. Reusable
Write it once, use it many times. Instead of copying the same code everywhere, you call the function whenever you need that task done.

### 2. Can Take Input
Functions can accept information (called parameters):
Like giving a chef ingredients to cook with

### 3. Can Give Output
Functions can return results (called return values):
Like a waiter bringing you your food

### 4. Organized & Clean
Functions keep your code neat by grouping related tasks together, making your program easier to understand and fix.
